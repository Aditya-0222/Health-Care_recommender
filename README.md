# Health-Care_recommender
Introduction
In this article, we will explore a Python code that implements a health recommendation system. The system takes user input for symptoms and provides recommendations for diseases, medicines, food recommendations, diet plans, and exercises based on the input.

Key Concepts
Before diving into the code, let's understand some key concepts:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): It is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document or a collection of documents. TF-IDF is commonly used in information retrieval and text mining to determine the relevance of a document to a user's query.

Cosine Similarity: It is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. In the context of the health recommendation system, cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between the user's symptoms and the symptoms mentioned in the dataset.

Code Structure
The code can be divided into the following sections:

Importing the required libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, TfidfVectorizer, and cosine_similarity.

Loading the dataset: The code reads a CSV file containing health-related data into a pandas DataFrame.

Combining relevant features: The code combines multiple features from the dataset into a single column called "combined_features". This column will be used for calculating TF-IDF vectors.

Creating a TF-IDF vectorizer: The code initializes a TfidfVectorizer object, which will be used to transform the dataset into TF-IDF vectors.

Transforming the dataset: The code applies the TF-IDF vectorizer to the "combined_features" column of the DataFrame, resulting in a matrix of TF-IDF vectors.

Defining the recommendation function: The code defines a function called "get_recommendations" that takes user symptoms as input and returns the top recommendations based on cosine similarity.

Getting user input: The code prompts the user to enter their symptoms.

Generating recommendations: The code calls the "get_recommendations" function with the user's symptoms as input and stores the recommendations in a variable.

Printing the recommendations: The code prints the top 10 recommendations, including disease name, medicine, food recommendation, diet plan, and exercise.
